Known Issues:

My partition does not pass pass the make tests.  The only way I was able to get it to pass what when it chose the partition based on the number of characters in string.  This didnt pass the algorithm tests becase sort() sorts alphabetically. So, as it is not it fails the partition but passes for both algorithms.

The performance of my merge sort is really bad compared to the quick sort. The resulting vector from the merge sort is calculated correctly so the tests are passing. I may be doing something stupid in the merge method though.
